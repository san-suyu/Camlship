Camlship is our team's final project to build a functional application utilizing Ocaml. Though most of our game is played within the terminal, we have added more functionalities to the original Battleship to create a more iteractive and fun gameplay. Camlship can be played either with our own AI, which has a few choice difficulties, or with another player if you share your device.
