  Our project is a replication of the game "Battleship" with new abilities and
  power ups, similar to the online game. The game currently supports the 
  creation of the game board, the placement of a limited number of ships, and
  checks whether the placements are valid or not on a simple UI in the terminal. 
  It aims to support attacks on ships, interesting power ups and new attacks, 
  and an option for the user to play against a simple AI or another player.
