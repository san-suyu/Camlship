(** custom ship structure with detailed properties of each ship *)

type custom_ship = {
  id : int;
  (* unique identifier for a ship *)
  cells : (int * int) list;
  (* list of coordinates occupied by ship *)
  health : int;
  (* health of the ship, typically equal to number of cells it occupies on
     grid *)

  (* top-left coordinate of the ship boundary*)
  width : int;
  (* width of the ships boundary *)
  height : int; (* height of ships boundary *)

(* Abstraction function: A custom_ship represents a unique ship on the grid with
   [id] as its identifier. The ship occupies [cells], each corresponding to a
   coordinate on the grid. [health] indicates the number of unhit cells, with
   initial value equal to the length of [cells]. [top_left] is the smallest
   coordinate by value that defines the upper left corner of the ship's bounding
   box. [width] and [height] define the dimensions of the smallest rectangle
   that can enclose the entire ship.

   Representation invariant: - [health] must be non-negative. - All coordinates
   in [cells] must be unique and within the grid bounds determined by the grid
   size. - [width] and [height] should be correctly calculated to contain all
   coordinates in [cells]. - [top_left] must actually be the coordinate with the
   smallest x and y values in [cells]. *)
